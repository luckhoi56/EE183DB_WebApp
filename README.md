# graphs-from-csv

An example repository for creating website graphs from CSV files. This repository uses c3.js and PapaParse.

### Graph/Chart Library
c3.js: http://c3js.org/

### CSV/JSON Parsing Library
PapaParse: http://papaparse.com/

### Only Requirement
You need a web server. I used python to initiate a web server.

```
python --version
Python 2.7.10
```

```
cd graphs-from-csv/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 to see the website.


### pyServer Library

To make the server run after import, you have to call
start_thread()
server_run()


The server will have two functions:
update (sent_message) #this message will be sent to the server
recv () # to recv the incoming message. To print the incoming message, you can call revc(1) to print to the console




1. THe interface should have IP connect to rasbperry pi
2. The rasp berry pi should have host as '0.0.0.0' to let 
other users connect to it
